### HOW TO USE:

1.  Within the form, type in the name of the burger you want to order. 
2. Once you have placed your order, the burger's name will populate under the header "On Your Table" along with a "Devour" button next to it.
3. If you click on the Devour button, the burger's name will move to the "In Your Stomach" list. 

A MySQL database deployed on Heroku keeps track of the id, burger name, and a boolean for whether or not the burger has been eaten.
